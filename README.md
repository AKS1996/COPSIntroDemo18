# WhoAmI

Our team submission for Microsoft Code.Fun.Do Round 1 at IIT(BHU) Varanasi. Its an Android App that provides you
information about a user by scanning a photo containing his/her face image.

The App is compatible with latest Android versions. It can read images from gallery or get a new image view camera.

We're using Microsoft's Cogitive API for face recognition, which returns a unique ID for every face.
That data is mapped to user's details which are stored on Azure SQL DB.
